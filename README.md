# Customers Line-Up - Software Engineering 2 Project

This project aimed at giving the specification of a project that a company holding supermarkets want to complete. Starting from the specification, the objective of the students was to create a "Requirement Analysis and Specification Document" analysing the requirement for the project and the specification. Then, the students were tasked also to produce a "Design Document" for the project, providing the design of the solutions needed to implement the project.

## Deliverables
The final documents that were produced during these project can be downloaded and viewed at these links:
- [Requirement Analysis and Specification Document](https://github.com/marcopetri98/CustomersLineUp_SWENG2/blob/main/DeliveryFolder/RASD.pdf)
- [Design Document](https://github.com/marcopetri98/CustomersLineUp_SWENG2/blob/main/DeliveryFolder/DD.pdf)

## Our approach to the problem
When we were analysing the requirements for the project, we tried to be as generic as possible such that the requirements will cover all the possible cases. However, we also stated requirements as specific as possible. Stating the requirement in a very specific way will constrain the design of the document, but will also make the contract with the customer more clear (I think is worth mentioning that there were no real investment and company for that project).

Moreover, since the solution has to be implemented physically, we tried to insert in the requirements for the project also surveillance. There might be people trying to violate rules, in this case we tried to insert some requirements allowing the control of such behaviours to detect them. The scope is that the overall system works smoothly.

Once we had finished the RASD document, we proceeded with the design of the solutions using UML diagrams. All diagrams can be found here:
